EXAMPLE: UPDATE LOCAL REPOSITORY
	git pull origin

EXAMPLE: CONTRIBUTE TO AN EXISTING REPOSITORY
	# Change Directory
	cd Desktop
	# download a repository on GitHub.com to our machine
	git clone https://github.com/me/repo.git

	# change into the `repo` directory
	cd TeamX

	# create a new branch to store any new changes
	git branch my-branch

	# switch to that branch (line of development)
	git checkout my-branch

	# make changes, for example, edit `file1.md` and `file2.md` using the text editor

	# stage the changed files
	git add file1.md file2.md

	# take a snapshot of the staging area (anything that's been added)
	git commit -m "my snapshot"

	# push changes to github
	git push --set-upstream origin my-branch

	
EXAMPLE: CONTRIBUTE TO AN EXISTING BRANCH ON GITHUB
	# assumption: a project called `TeamX` already exists on the machine, and a new branch has been pushed to GitHub.com since the last time changes were made locally

	# change into the `repo` directory
	cd TeamX

	# update all remote tracking branches, and the currently checked out branch
	git pull

	# change into the existing branch called `feature-a`
	git checkout feature-a

	# make changes, for example, edit `file1.md` using the text editor

	# stage the changed file
	git add file1.md

	# take a snapshot of the staging area
	git commit -m "edit file1"

	# push changes to github
	git push
